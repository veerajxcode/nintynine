# NintyNine - A WordPress Blog Theme (In Progress)

Welcome to **NintyNine**, a WordPress blog-based theme currently under development. üöß

This theme is being built with a focus on simplicity, performance, and extendability, following modern WordPress standards. **NintyNine** will provide a sleek and customizable design suitable for various types of blogs. As the theme evolves, it will incorporate various features to enhance the user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features (Planned)

### 1. **Singleton Design Pattern**
- The theme utilizes the **Singleton design pattern** to ensure that there‚Äôs only one instance of the core classes throughout the lifecycle of the theme. This approach ensures cleaner, more maintainable code and avoids the unnecessary repetition of instantiations.

### 2. **Custom Blocks**
- **NintyNine** will include custom Gutenberg blocks, designed to provide more flexibility in content creation for WordPress users.
- These blocks will be fully customizable and seamlessly integrated with the WordPress editor, offering a smooth user experience.

### 3. **Block Patterns**
- The theme will also come with a variety of pre-designed **block patterns**, which allow users to easily build complex page layouts with a single click. These patterns will be designed for blog posts, headers, footers, and other common sections.

### 4. **Future Functionalities**
- **Advanced customization options** for typography, colors, and layouts.
- **Performance optimization** for faster loading times and improved SEO.
- **Support for third-party plugins** to extend functionality without compromising theme performance.
- **Regular updates** with new blocks, patterns, and other features to keep the theme up-to-date with the latest WordPress developments.

Feel free to explore the projects and provide any feedback or suggestions. üòä
